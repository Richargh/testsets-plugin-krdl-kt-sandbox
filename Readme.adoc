= Testsets Gradle Library Sandbox

We play around with the community link:https://github.com/unbroken-dome/gradle-testsets-plugin[Gradle TestSets plugin]. Does not have any business logic to speak of but features lots of dependencies between the testsets. If you want to use the official Test Suite plugin you can take a look at this link:https://github.com/Richargh/testsuite-plugin-krdl-kt-sandbox[Repository] instead.

*Features*

* Multi-project
* Small, Medium, Large Testsets via link:https://github.com/unbroken-dome/gradle-testsets-plugin[community testset plugin]
* Shared Test library
* Tagged and disabled tests

== Usage
