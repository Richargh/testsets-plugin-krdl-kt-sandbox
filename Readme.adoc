= Testsets Gradle Library Sandbox

We play around with the link:https://github.com/unbroken-dome/gradle-testsets-plugin[Gradle TestSets plugin]. Does not have any business logic to speak of but features lots of dependencies between the testsets.

*Features*

* Multi-project
* Small, Medium, Large Testsets
* Shared Test library
* Tagged and disabled tests

== Usage

Build and run all tests: `./gradlew build`

Play around by enabling, disabling or changing tags of tests.
